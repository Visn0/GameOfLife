The directories are:

+ /Generator/:
    - /images/: contains plots comparing parallel generator vs sequential generator.
    - /patterns/: contains patters generated by the generators.
    - /reports/: contains the execution report of both generators.
    - /results/: stores the results of executing the parallel generator with [1,4] threads and the sequential. This can also include the speedup.
    - generator_parallel.cpp: code implementing OpenMP parallelization.
    - generator_sequential.cpp.
    - makefile.
    - plot.gnuplot: to run this, execute the following --> gnuplot plot.gnuplot
        * creates the plots of the data found in /results/.
    - results_parallel.sh: executes the parallel generator changing automatically the number of threads and the amount of data used.
        * Creates the files /results/parallel.n.thread.time, where n is the number of threads used for that execution.
    - results_sequential.sh: executes the sequential generator changing automatically the amount of data used and creates the file /results/sequential.time


+ /Simulator/:
    - /images/: contains plots comparing parallel simulator vs sequential simulator.    
    - /reports/: contains the execution report of both simulators.
    - /results/: stores the results of executing the parallel simulator with [1,4] threads and the sequential. This can also include the speedup.
    - simulator_parallel.cpp: code implementing OpenMP parallelization.
    - simulator_sequential.cpp.
    - makefile.
    - plot.gnuplot: to run this, execute the following --> gnuplot plot.gnuplot
        * creates the plots of the data found in /results/.
    - results_parallel.sh: executes the parallel simulator changing automatically the number of threads and the amount of data used.
        * Creates the files /results/parallel.n.thread.time, where n is the number of threads used for that execution.
    - results_sequential.sh: executes the sequential simulator changing automatically the amount of data used and creates the file /results/sequential.time

+ calculate_speedup.cpp: using the data created by the scripts results_parallel.sh and results_sequential.sh in /Generator/results/ or /Simulator/results/,
    calculates the speedup obtained with the parallelization and create the file speedup.n.thread in one of those folders. n is the number of threads.

+ makefile: used to compile calculate_speedup.cpp
